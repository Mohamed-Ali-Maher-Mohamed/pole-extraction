# fusion
Note: A new folder, named `fusion` has been added to this repository. This folder contains the code for fusing traffic feature detections from the Cityscapes segmentation into the COCO segmentation results.

## `fuse_traffic_features.py`
This file contains code to fuse three traffic features, namely traffic lights, traffic signs, and poles, from the Cityscapes segmentation into the COCO segmentation results.

## `insert_poles_to_coco.py`
This files contains code to fuse only the pole detections from the Cityscapes segmentation into the COCO segmentation results.

Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation library
that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms.
It is the successor of
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/)
and [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).
It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.

## What's New
* Includes new capabilities such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend,
  DeepLab, ViTDet, MViTv2 etc.
* Used as a library to support building [research projects](projects/) on top of it.
* Models can be exported to TorchScript format or Caffe2 format for deployment.
* It [trains much faster](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html).

See our [blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/)
to see more demos and learn about detectron2.
